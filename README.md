# Alpine Hardened Image

A hardened alpine linux image based on [jumanjiman/harden.sh](https://gist.github.com/jumanjiman/f9d3db977846c163df12) 

Inspired by: 
- https://github.com/gliderlabs/docker-alpine/issues/101
- https://github.com/gliderlabs/docker-alpine/issues/56

This image serves as a reference example. In practice, you will probably want to harden your own image after you've built everything, rather than rely on a hardened base image.
